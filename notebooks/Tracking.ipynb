But what if the user who discovers a bug is different from the developer who eventually fixes it? In this case, users have to _report_ bugs, and one needs to ensure that reported bugs are systematically _tracked_. This is the job of dedicated _bug tracking systems_, which we will discuss (and demo) in this chapter."
